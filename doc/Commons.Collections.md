  * __HashedMap__, a hash map (dictionary).
  
  * __Customized32HashedMap__, a hash map (dictionary) whose hash function can be defined other than using Object.GetHashCode().
  
  * __TreeMap__, a sorted map (dictionary). The map is navigable.
  
  * __SkipListMap__, a sorted map (dictionary). The map is navigable.
  
  * __LruMap__, a hash map (dictionary) implemented with least recently used algorithm. The map size is bounded and the oldest item is eliminated when the map size is full. 
  
  * __ReferenceMap__, a hash map (dictionary) which calculates the hash value only from its key object reference value.
  
  * __LinkedHashedMap__, an ordered map (dictionary) which remembers the adding sequence of the items.
  
  * __HashedBimap__, an unsorted bidirectional map. A bidirectional map is a map which can be used to find a value from a key and a key from a value.
  
  * __TreeBimap__, a sorted bidirectional map. 
  
  * __MultiValueHashedMap__, an unsorted map where multiple values are allowed for a given key.
  
  * __MultiValueTreeMap__, a sorted version of multi-value map.
  
  * __HashedBag__, a bag containing the unsorted items. A bag is a collection that allows duplicate values.
  
  * __TreeBag__, a bag containing the sorted items.
  
  * __Deque__, a double ended queue.

  * __LinkedDeque__, a double ended queue with linked list as inside data structure.
  
  * __MaxPriorityQueue__, a priority queue where the maximum item is at the top.
  
  * __MinPriorityQueue__, a priority queue where the minimum item is at the top.
  
  * __BoundedQueue__, a FIFO queue with a maximum size.
  
  * __HashedSet__, a set with unsorted items. It's a set strictly follows the definition in maths.
  
  * __TreeSet__, a set with sorted items. It's a set strictly follows the definition in maths.
  
  * __SkipListSet__, a set with sorted items. It's a set strictly follows the definition in maths.

  * __ReferenceSet__, a hash set which calculates the hash value only from its object reference value.
  
  * __LinkedSet__, an ordered set where the elements are sequenced by the adding order.

  * __LruSet__, an ordered set where the elements are sequenced by the least recently used algorithm. The set is bounded and the oldest item is eliminated when the size is full.
