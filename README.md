commonsfornet
=============

.net implementation of apache commons collections, pooling and chains.

The commons collections includes a wide range of data structures, like bag, set, map, deque, multimap, etc, which are not supported in the .net framework so far.
There includes a .net implementation for left leaning red black tree, which is used as the inner data structure of a tree set and tree map. The implementation of other map like data structure, like indexed collection, are all based on this structure.
